Hi, I'm Nicolas Bontempo! I'm a software enginner, currently working with [Take](take.net) as a Tech Lead.

I created this space as an experimental ground to develop my own ideas and share them with others. I started writing on portuguese, after a few years I changed my mind and started writing on english.

I'm on a eternal learning path and maybe you can follow my journey.
