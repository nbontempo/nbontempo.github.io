Recently, I have studied more and more about how a company should handle incidents and how a product team should structure themselves to create a better value for the final user. This is my reading list about the subjects:

- [Extreme ownership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqra3BcqWM) - In this TED talk, Jocko Willink shows how you can increase team performance, reliability, and create a culture of self-improvement by having ownership. I think that one of the best examples on the software domain is the [nubank speak (Sobrevivendo a escala)](https://www.infoq.com/br/presentations/sobrevivendo-a-escala/) that they show how extreme ownership can be powerful to change the perspective of the incident and this can improve the culture of the company.

- [Incident Analysis: How *Learning* is Different Than *Fixing*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFcTNH2iUBM) - This youtube video is a talk with John Allspaw, where he encourages the methodology that you should try to learn with the incident and not focus only on fixing the problem. The talk focus on the side that you should always try to learn to resolve the incident, because the mentality of trying to fix the incident will prevent you from learning.
    - [Characteristics of Next-Level Incident Reports in Software](https://www.learningfromincidents.io/blog/characteristics-of-next-level-incident-reports-in-software) - This article written by Ryan Kitchens shows some examples of how to better handle incidents so that the team can learn from them and how incidents can improve the overall software quality.
    - [How Your Systems Keep Running Day After Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA5U85LSk0M) - This talk with John Allspaw (same speaker) talks that incidents are opportunities to do new training, new tooling, new organizational structures, new funding dynamics, insights your competitor doesn't have, and if you are not learning from incidents you are missing opportunities that maybe your competitor is not missing.

- [Spotify doesn’t use “the Spotify model” and neither should you](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/) - In this article Jeremiah Lee (worked on Spotify) presents how the "Spotify model" was not the agile utopia that is observed on the articles and the outside view of Spotify. In the end of the article, there are some recommendations of more successful models compared to the Spotify model:
    - For organizations with more than 200 people in the product he suggests [Scaled agile framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) from Fitbit 
    - For organizations with less than 200 people in the product he suggests [Shape Up by Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/shapeup).

- [How to have impact](https://vishalkapur.com/how-to-have-impact/) - In this article Vishal Kapur debates about how to make an impact in the present society and how tasks that appear to not have high impact can cause more impact than you think.

- [Refactoring: This class is too large](https://martinfowler.com/articles/class-too-large.html) - This article of Martin Fowler walks through real codebase refactoring.

- [Modular Monolith with DDD](https://github.com/kgrzybek/modular-monolith-with-ddd) - This Github repo created by Kamil Grzybek shows the process of creating software, with really great documentation and a real code example.

- [Why software architects fail - and what to do about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkYDsiRVqno&feature=youtu.be&t=272) - This video tells some mistakes that can be avoided by a software architect and I think some of them can be applied for developer too, it's a very nice video that you can learn from others mistakes.
